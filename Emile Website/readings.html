<h2>September 21st 2020 Reflection on “As We May Think”</h2>
<p>Bush’s  notes from around the time of the 1940s give us great insight about some of the thoughts scientists had in this era. At the World Expo of 1939,  a machine called a Voder was showcased which was able to record people’s voices. From this I find it interesting that Bush was able to make a concept for a futuristic machine that inspired the following generation to create the internet. The early internet was, as originally envisioned for his machine, all about establishing quick and reliable communications for information archiving and sharing within the scientific community. What really strikes me is that the internet drew inspiration from Bush and his older ideas but also took on its own twist from the populist era in which it was developed.

Later in the magazine, Bush describes a semi automated payment system that would work similar to the modern day credit card. Originally Bush thought of a way that an automated system would calculate costs and keep track of inventory. This part in particular reminded me of a comedy skit involving a man working within an atm that was a commentary on how we still delegate tasks best fit for machines to humans instead.

Bush comments that “Our present languages are not especially adapted to this sort of mechanization, it is true. It is strange that the inventors of universal languages have not seized upon the idea of producing one which better fitted the technique for transmitting and recording speech.”. I found this to be particularly interesting. As he rightfully points out, reading code as a language is difficult for someone who isn’t very familiar with the way specific coding languages are structured because of how mechanical it is in its nature. Bush seemed to lean more on the side that a new spoken language would emerge that would accommodate for this but from what I know things have developed to be quite the opposite. There is this website, which it’s name I can’t remember, that creates HTML code based on what the user types. For example: by inputting “Red button” the program creates the line of HTML code for a red button. I just found this to be an interesting observation that sometimes technology develops in unexpected ways.

<h2>October 3rd 2020 Reflection on The Time Canada Wanted Its Own Internet</h2>

<p>It’s interesting to see that the United Nations was perfectly fine with foreign companies being able to extract whatever information from users. They must have known that the globalization and eventual commodification of the internet would benefit the most well-funded online companies at the cost of eclipsing smaller local ones. Given the benefit of the doubt, I can see these details being overlooked in the 70s but the fact that this has led to further problems since then including the emerging tech monopolies that have not been properly addressed since then comes across as willful ignorance to me.

<h2>October 15th 2020 Reflection on The History of Net Art</h2>

<p>Today people seem to have returned to having their own personal website just as in the internet’s early days. As a result of an oversaturation of social media platforms even the most casual of artists seems to be creating their own website, or at least webpage, with links to all their social media accounts.

The topic of monetization is a difficult one. As with many of the more abstract pieces it’s not as easy to monetize as something you can physically own or a live performance you can attend. What is probably one of the better ways for artists to continue their craft is some form of patronage from people who have stumbled across said work and liked it.
