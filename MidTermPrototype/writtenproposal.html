<h4>
  Maxime Bernier is a Canadian Politician who split from the Conservative party to create a new political party further to the right on every issue with a particular focus on cutting immigration. This project would be a satirical version of Maxime Bernier’s campaign website that criticizes the irrational and fear driven opposition to immigration. </h4>

<h4>	The homepage will look similar to the one he had made for his attempt to be elected as party leader for the Conservative party in 2017. It isn’t meant to be anything unexpected, it is supposed to give the visitor the impression that they are actually on this Conservative politician’s website. It has pictures of Maxime Bernier, a few news articles and links to other web pages with information on more particular subjects. At the top of every webpage there is a navigation bar with links to pages for general info and volunteering as well as a policy page that is highlighted with an announcement that it has been revised. </h4>

<section class = "right">
<h4> On the policy page the user is presented with 6 boxes arranged in a CSS grid with pictures for various topics concerning immigration. The visitor can click on any of the boxes to bring them to a web page. These pages will either poke fun at the unfair framing of specific issues or directly address one specific argument that has been propagated by xenophobic misinformation campaigns. An example of the former would be box on the topic of terrorism. In a bait and switch fashion, an image of a mosque is displayed and with a text about how as prime minister Maxime Bernier would put in place security measures to combat terrorism but it is revealed that it is talking specifically talking about combating alt-right terrorists that often target immigrant communities. Some of these will also have interactive components such as sliders to see the positive impacts of affordable housing or foreign aid as more is invested. The other points include the lower crime rate, positive economic impacts to immigration and strengthening social cohesion. </h4>

<h4>	Whilst brainstorming for this project, I initially was going to make a parody website of some of the Canadian alt-right political pundits such as Faith Goldy but I found that their xenophobic rhetoric was a little too on-the-nose for satire and ultimately decided to settle on something that was a little more approachable. I am However, still taking inspiration from the layout, topics and presentation of these websites.
	The initial inspiration for this project’s topic is a Sacha Baron Cohen episode of Who is America (Cohen,WIA). In this episode Cohen plays a character who gives a presentation at a town hall meeting in Kingman Arizona to citizens, he tells them about a plan to build the world’s largest mosque outside of the middle east inciting all manner of furious and racist reactions from the citizens attending. This made me wonder how I could potentially make Canadian’s with similar beliefs become self-aware of them and dispel the false narrative that has been spun around the topic of immigration here in Canada. Ultimately, that is the goal; make the visitor reflect and question some of the beliefs they held or heard others share and never really pushed back on.
