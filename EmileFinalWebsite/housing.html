Our party wants to build 500,000 affordable housing units over 10 years; until then, they propose a rental subsidy. We want to scrap the federal GST/HST for those constructing new affordable units. Our party would reintroduce 30-year terms for mortgages insured by the CMHC for first-time buyers and give low-interest loans to retrofit houses. A 15 per cent surtax on foreign buyers and doubling the home buyerâ€™s tax credit to $1,500.
