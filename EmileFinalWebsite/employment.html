<p> Working life keeps getting harder for Canadians. People, especially young people, are having a hard time finding secure, full-time jobs with benefits – instead they’re juggling part-time jobs and struggling to make ends meet.

The growth of low-paid, insecure work is the result of decades of decisions by Liberal and Conservative governments – from scrapping the federal minimum wage in the 1990s to telling Canadians to “get used to” short-term, precarious work.

This is unacceptible, low income working class Canadians working full time shouldn't be struggling to get by. Our vision is to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.
